Project Description: Modernization of the OMV's Customer Area

As part of the OMV's modernization project, we focused on creating and developing the Customer Area, a centralized platform where OMV's business clients can access essential information about their contracts and services. This Customer Area was designed to provide an intuitive and comprehensive experience, allowing users to access a variety of important data, including account balances, types of services contracted, consumption, estimates, and other relevant values and information.

Key Implemented Features:

Customized Dashboard: We created a personalized dashboard for each client, providing a quick and accessible overview of critical information such as account balances, recent invoices, and current consumption.
Balance and Invoice Inquiry: We developed functionalities that allow clients to check their account balances in real-time and view details of previous invoices, including due dates, amounts, and billed items.
Service Types Visualization: We implemented a dedicated section for clients to view the types of services contracted, including details about service plans, applicable rates, and associated benefits.
Consumption Analysis and Estimates: We integrated data analysis tools that enable clients to monitor their consumption over time and receive estimates of future expenses based on historical consumption patterns.
Additional Personalized Information: In addition to essential data, clients can access additional personalized information such as performance reports, service updates, and account status alerts.
Transaction History: We implemented a section where clients can view a detailed history of all transactions and activities related to their accounts and contracted services.
Self-Service Tools: We integrated self-service tools that allow clients to perform actions such as updating contact information, configuring notification preferences, and managing access authorizations.
Results and Impact:

The modernization of the Customer Area has significantly improved the client experience for companies that contract OMV's services. By providing transparent and convenient access to a wide range of information and functionalities, clients can make more informed decisions, optimize their resources, and effectively control their operations related to OMV. This initiative has also contributed to strengthening the relationship between OMV and its clients, increasing satisfaction and loyalty.

This description highlights the focus of the development on creating the Customer Area and emphasizes the key implemented features to improve the client experience and increase OMV's operational efficiency, including offering a wide variety of values and relevant information for clients.
